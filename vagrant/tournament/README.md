# Tournament Database #

This project contains PostgreSQL tournament database schema and some Python methods to add, remove, and display data. In order to run the code, you must have Python and psql installed. 

### Installing the Database ###
From the command line, navigate to the `tournament` directory and run `psql -f tournament.sql`. This creates the database and tables.

### Running the Unit Tests ###
To test the methods in tournament.py, run `python tournament_test.py`.
